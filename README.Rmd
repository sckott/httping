`httping` is a tiny R package to Ping urls to time requests. It's a port of the Python [httping](https://github.com/jpignata/httping) library.

## Quick start

### Install

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sckott/httping")
```

```{r}
library("httping")
```

## Pass any httr request to time

A `GET` request

```{r}
GET("http://google.com") %>% time(count=3)
```

A `POST` request

```{r}
POST("http://httpbin.org/post", body = "A simple text string") %>% time(count=3)
```

The return object is a list with slots for all the `httr` response objects, the times for each request, and the average times. The number of requests, and 
the delay between requests are included as attributes. 

```{r}
res <- GET("http://google.com") %>% time(count=3)
attributes(res)
```
